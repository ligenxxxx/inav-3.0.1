# INAV Programming Framework

INAV Programming Framework (abbr. IPF) is a mechanism that allows to evaluate cenrtain flight parameters (RC channels, switches, altitude, distance, timers, other logic conditions) and use the value of evaluated expression in different places of INAV. Currently, the result of LCs can be used in:

* [Servo mixer](Mixer.md) to activate/deactivate certain servo mix rulers
* To activate/deactivate system overrides

INAV Programming Framework coinsists of:

* Logic Conditions - each Logic Condition can be understood as a single command, a single line of code
* Global Variables - variables that can store values from and for LogiC Conditions and servo mixer
* Programming PID - general purpose, user configurable PID controllers

IPF can be edited using INAV Configurator user interface, of via CLI

## Logic Conditions

### CLI

`logic <rule> <enabled> <activatorId> <operation> <operand A type> <operand A value> <operand B type> <operand B value> <flags>`

* `<rule>` - ID of Logic Condition rule
* `<enabled>` - `0` evaluates as disabled, `1` evaluates as enabled
* `<activatorId>` - the ID of _LogicCondition_ used to activate this _Condition_. _Logic Condition_ will be evaluated only then Activator evaluates as `true`. `-1` evaluates as `true`
* `<operation>` - See `Operations` paragraph
* `<operand A type>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<operand A value>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<operand B type>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<operand B value>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<flags>` - See `Flags` paragraph

### Flags

All flags are reseted on ARM and DISARM event.

| bit   | Decimal   | Function              |
|----   |----       |----                   |
| 0     | 1         | Latch - after activation LC will stay active until LATCH flag is reseted |

## Global variables

### CLI

`gvar <index> <default value> <min> <max>`

## Programming PID

`pid <index> <enabled> <setpoint type> <setpoint value> <measurement type> <measurement value> <P gain> <I gain> <D gain> <FF gain>`

* `<index>` - ID of PID Controller, starting from `0`
* `<enabled>` - `0` evaluates as disabled, `1` evaluates as enabled
* `<setpoint type>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<setpoint value>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<measurement type>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<measurement value>` - See `Operands` paragraph
* `<P gain>` - P-gain, scaled to `1/1000`
* `<I gain>` - I-gain, scaled to `1/1000`
* `<D gain>` - D-gain, scaled to `1/1000`
* `<FF gain>` - FF-gain, scaled to `1/1000`

## Examples

### Dynamic THROTTLE scale

`logic 0 1 0 23 0 50 0 0 0`

Limits the THROTTLE output to 50% when Logic Condition `0` evaluates as `true`

### Set VTX power level via Smart Audio

`logic 0 1 0 25 0 3 0 0 0`

Sets VTX power level to `3` when Logic Condition `0` evaluates as `true`

### Invert ROLL and PITCH when rear facing camera FPV is used

Solves the problem from [https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/issues/4439](https://github.com/iNavFlight/inav/issues/4439)

```
logic 0 1 0 26 0 0 0 0 0
logic 1 1 0 27 0 0 0 0 0
```

Inverts ROLL and PITCH input when Logic Condition `0` evaluates as `true`. Moving Pitch stick up will cause pitch down (up for rear facing camera). Moving Roll stick right will cause roll left of a quad (right in rear facing camera)

### Cut motors but keep other throttle bindings active

`logic 0 1 0 29 0 1000 0 0 0`

Sets Thhrottle output to `0%` when Logic Condition `0` evaluates as `true`

### Set throttle to 50% and keep other throttle bindings active

`logic 0 1 0 29 0 1500 0 0 0`

Sets Thhrottle output to about `50%` when Logic Condition `0` evaluates as `true`

### Set throttle control to different RC channel

`logic 0 1 0 29 1 7 0 0 0`

If Logic Condition `0` evaluates as `true`, motor throttle control is bound to RC channel 7 instead of throttle channel

### Set VTX channel with a POT

Set VTX channel with a POT on the radio assigned to RC channel 6

```
logic 0 1 -1 15 1 6 0 1000 0
logic 1 1 -1 37 4 0 0 7 0
logic 2 1 -1 14 4 1 0 1 0
logic 3 1 -1 31 4 2 0 0 0
```

Steps:
1. Normalize range `[1000:2000]` to `[0:1000]` by substracting `1000`
2. Scale range `[0:1000]` to `[0:7]`
3. Increase range by `1` to have the range of `[1:8]`
4. Assign LC#2 to VTX channel function

### Set VTX power with a POT

Set VTX power with a POT on the radio assigned to RC channel 6. In this example we scale POT to 4 power level `[1:4]`

```
logic 0 1 -1 15 1 6 0 1000 0
logic 1 1 -1 37 4 0 0 3 0
logic 2 1 -1 14 4 1 0 1 0
logic 3 1 -1 25 4 2 0 0 0
```

Steps:
1. Normalize range [1000:2000] to [0:1000] by substracting `1000`
2. Scale range [0:1000] to [0:3]
3. Increase range by `1` to have the range of [1:4]
4. Assign LC#2 to VTX power function
